Simple Car Racing Game SFML/Graphics
The project is designed to run on UBUNTU 16.04LTS. It uses SFML/Graphics.hpp header of C to run the program.

The car racer game is designed to move the entire background and the textures. The center car.png remains still at the lower center of the display.
The movement is done by using the arrow keys.
